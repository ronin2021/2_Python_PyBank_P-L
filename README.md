# Python - Homework - PyBank

## Outline
Consider all data files and the main.ipynb file that has the code for the script is in the PyBank folder.


The main.ipynb script will read the month-year data with corresponding profit/loss data for a collection of financial records of a company from ***budget_data.csv*** file. Then it extracts the data to a two lists. From these lists following outputs are calculated: 
1. The total number of months in the data period
2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire data period
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire data period
4. The greatest increase in profits (month-year and amount) over the entire data period.
5. The greatest increase in losses (month-year and amount) over the entire data period.

Outputs of these are shown ***on the terminal*** and given out to into ***output.txt*** file. 

## Inputs
Read in as **Month-Year** with corresponding **Profit/Loss** data read from a ***budget_data.csv*** file in the PyBank folder/directory. 

## Outputs
Are given out as mentioned above in the *Outline* on the terminal as well as given out in ***output.txt*** file in the PyBank folder/directory.

## Remarks
The outputs which have currency values shown with "*$*" denominations and commas seperating thousands.
The outputs which are numerical rounded to the second decimal place.
